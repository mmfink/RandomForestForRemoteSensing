Information about the random forets classificaiton R script and guide

An R script and guide are being developed as tools to do image classification 
such as land cover classification using a random forests classifier. 
This is a work in progress and the intent is to provide robust methods 
that can be used by people with minimal remote sensing experience and 
improved by integrating your comments and requests. The guide should 
be easy to follow. If it's not please let me know and I'll try to 
improve it. These methods are still being tested so problems will 
likely occur until I get sufficient feedback to improve the process for 
a broad range of uses.

Here are the different resources available in this archive:
- A guide to use an R script to classify a satellite image and/or 
additional conitnuous or discreate image layers 
- An R script to classify an image and output a classified map as well 
as additional information about accuracy and information about the quality 
of your training data
