Information about the segmentation R scripts and guides

A set of R scripts and guides are being developed as tools to create continuous fields (percent cover) layers. This is a work in progress and the intent is to provide robust methods that can be used by people with minimal remote sensing experience. These materials can be improved by integrating your comments and requests. 
The guide should be easy to follow. If it's not please let me know 
and I'll try to improve it. These methods are still being tested so problems 
will likely occur until I get sufficient feedback to improve the process for a
broad range of uses.

Here are the different resources available in this archive:

- An R scrip and guide to create continuous fields layers from satellite imagery.
- An R script to pre-precess an image to prepare it to be input into the continuous fields script.
- A script and guide to adjust the results of the continusous fields layers to reduce the bias inhearent in using random forests for regression
- An R script to classify a multi-band image using image segments.
