Information about the segmentation R scripts and guides

A set of R scripts and a guide are being developed as tools to do image 
classification such as land cover classification using image segmentation  
and a random forests classifier. This is a work in progress and the intent is 
to provide robust methods that can be used by people with minimal remote 
sensing experience and improved by integrating your comments and requests. 
The guide is long but should be easy to follow. If it's not please let me know 
and I'll try to improve it. These methods are still being tested so problems 
will likely occur until I get sufficient feedback to improve the process for a
broad range of uses.

Here are the different resources available in this archive:
- A guide to use open source software to segment an image and classify the
  segments using a random forest classifier. 
- An R script to create features (predictor variables) from image segments and a 
  multi-band image
- An R script to classify a multi-band image using image segments
- An R script to modify classification results
